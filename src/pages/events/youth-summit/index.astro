        Youth Summits are 4-day conferences for university students and young
        adults who are 18+ years old. With the Youth Summit being one of our
        major events that usually take place in the Summer, it usually welcomes
        approximately 100 participants from all over Cyprus and all over Europe.
        The conference allows participants to discuss amongst teams, but also
        with experts and high profile decision makers, topics that Cyprus and
        Europe currently face. The event and its activities help participants
        develop invaluable skills both for their studies and early careers.
        Through teambuilding activities, Committee Work where teams discuss
        various important topics, their opinions and suggestions as well as
        through a General Assembly, participants develop their teamwork,
        cooperation, communication and public speaking skills. If you are
        interested in participating in the next Youth Summit, get in touch with
        with our HR officer at members@eypcyprus.com to find out more
        information.

        Team building in the context of the European Youth Parliament, means
        communication training, focused on group dynamics. The fundamental
        purpose of team building is to get a disparate group of individuals
        working as a team, through a series of physical, theoretical and
        problem-solving activities. Under the guidance of their committee
        Chairperson, the delegates will participate in a series of group dynamic
        exercises and problem-solving tasks, in order to get to know each other
        and begin functioning as a group.

        This is the central part of any EYP session. After team-building, the
        delegates come together to discuss their allocated topics, and will
        explore the skills needed to discuss, debate and communicate effectively
        within their committee. The goal of Committee work is the production of
        a strong and meaningful resolution, that will be debated upon during the
        General Assembly.

      <SessionElementCard className='w-5/6 max-w-5xl' title='Discussing Europe'>
        Discussing Europe has been established as an annual happening at our
        sessions - an event welcoming various guests in a panel discussion
        centred around the session theme. During this event, participants have
        the opportunity to interact with professionals with expertise in the
        field, as well as experienced political figures.

        The General Assembly reunites all the participants of the session to
        consider the results of committee work. Each committee presents and
        defends their motion for a resolution, which is then debated according
        to the current model of the European Parliament.
