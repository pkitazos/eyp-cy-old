        The Pre-Selection Days of EYP Cyprus have been organised annually since
        2010 and welcome about 22-26 school delegations for a 2 day conference
        where young people have the opportunity to discuss current European
        issues through a General Assembly. With about 180 participants every
        year taking part in the event, the Pre-Selection Days serve as the first
        contact of young people with the organisation and it's an opportunity
        for 16 school delegations to be selected to attend our National Session.
        Pre-Selection Days 2021 will take place between the 5th and 7th of
        March. You can get information on how to register by contacting us.

        Team building in the context of the European Youth Parliament, means
        communication training, focused on group dynamics. The fundamental
        purpose of team building is to get a disparate group of individuals
        working as a team, through a series of physical, theoretical and
        problem-solving activities. Under the guidance of their committee
        Chairperson, the delegates will participate in a series of group dynamic
        exercises and problem-solving tasks, in order to get to know each other
        and begin functioning as a group.

        The General Assembly reunites all the participants of the session to
        consider the results of committee work. Each committee presents and
        defends their motion for a resolution, which is then debated according
        to the current model of the European Parliament.
