        The EYP Day was established in 2019 and takes place annually. It
        welcomed approximately 50 - 80 young people to a one day conference
        where they can discuss current issues. This event allows young people to
        join EYP's activities without having to attend as a school delegation.
        EYP Day 2021 will take place between the 3rd and 4th of April. You can
        get information on how to register by contacting us.

        Team building in the context of the European Youth Parliament, means
        communication training, focused on group dynamics. The fundamental
        purpose of team building is to get a disparate group of individuals
        working as a team, through a series of physical, theoretical and
        problem-solving activities. Under the guidance of their committee
        Chairperson, the delegates will participate in a series of group dynamic
        exercises and problem-solving tasks, in order to get to know each other
        and begin functioning as a group.

        This is the central part of any EYP session. After team-building, the
        delegates come together to discuss their allocated topics, and will
        explore the skills needed to discuss, debate and communicate effectively
        within their committee. The goal of Committee work is the production of
        a strong and meaningful resolution, that will be debated upon during the
        General Assembly.

      <SessionElementCard className='w-5/6 max-w-5xl' title='General Assembly'>
        The General Assembly reunites all the participants of the session to
        consider the results of committee work. Each committee presents and
        defends their motion for a resolution, which is then debated according
        to the current model of the European Parliament.
