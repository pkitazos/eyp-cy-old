      The European Youth Parliament Cyprus offers its participants a unique
      learning experience. Every year, 500+ young people from both Cyprus and
      Europe join our activities. There are various ways to get involved -
      typically, the first step is to participate in one of our EYP sessions
      which take place throughout the year. At the same time, we hold various
      open events, discussion forums, workshops, trainings and panel discussions
      which you can join! Get in touch and follow us on social media to keep up
      to date with opportunities to take part in our activities.

        If you are a High-School Student aged 15-18, you can register
        individually to attend our EYP Day. If your school is interested in
        applying as a delegation of six students, then you are able to attend
        our Pre-Selection Days. Both events usually take place in March and
        April. Through these events, you could be selected to attend EYP Cyprus'
        annual National Session in the Summer. If you are interested in
        attending either of these events, you can contact our HR
        members@eypcyprus.com to declare your interest or ask for further
        details.
