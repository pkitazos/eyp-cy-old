      With non-formal education at the heart of our activities, we provide young
      people with a non-partisan and independent forum to formulate and discuss
      their opinions about current issues both with each other and relevant
      policy makers - all while developing vital skills! Through a wide range of
      activities - from conferences, workshops, think tanks, trainings, panel
      discussions among others EYP Cyprus also provides young people with spaces
      to connect with each other and build intercultural understanding and
      friendships across Cyprus and Europe. With 15+ events annually, and 500+
      participants at our activities each year, our organisation is growing and
      reaching more and more young people! And with EYP Cyprus being part of the
      wider EYP Network present in 40+ countries in Europe, our members and
      alumni have the opportunity to join over 30,000 young people who take part
      in more than 500 EYP events organised across Europe every year.

      Our activities provide a unique educational experience to young people and
      allow them to develop transferable professional skills. Participants in
      our events have the opportunity to engage in discussions with other young
      people from Cyprus and all over Europe and exchange ideas on current
      socio-political issues. During 2020 and the pandemic, we focused on
      providing the youth with a platform to express their concerns, fears, and
      hopes, as well as ideas and views of the future. We therefore organised
      numerous events digitally or in a hybrid format that ultimately aimed to
      empower Cypriot youth and encourage them to be active citizens in their
      communities especially during this difficult time. EYP Cyprus is
      constantly seeking to expand, engage more young people in its activities,
      and furthering its impact!
