# EYP Cyprus Website

This is an informational, static site for the non-profit NGO, European Youth Parliamant (EYP) Cyprus.

The site is built using NextJS 13, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Tech Stack

NextJS 13 was used to server-render pages which improves load times, and SEO.
TypeScript and TailwindCSS were chosen, primarily, for their improved DX.

## TODO still

- Ensure that site is fully accessible to people who prefer keyboard navigation or who use screen-readers. This can be achieved by ensuring semantic HTML is used as well as by applying the appropriate aria-roles.

- Add lazy animations and interactivity to different sections of the site, to elevate UI.

- remove unused libraries can potentially get rid of headless UI and rebuild animated Popover with Shadcn and Framer Motion

- add parallax effect to WaveDividers
